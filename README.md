# Silver Minded
Silver Minded helps track and organize all the different facets of your life, bringing everything together into one central place to de-clutter your mind. The main goal of this application was to solve the problem of an overwhelmed mind to encourage growth and improvement within your life.

The application is broken down into four main concepts: tasks, events, transactions, and trees. The tasks list in the Dash page is for high priority or quick, executable tasks. The events in the Time page are meant to help organize your plans and overall time. In the Bank page, one's transactions are tracked and broken down into categories for improved insight on spending. Lastly is the tree concept, which are documents that you can make in the Mind page to hold any sort of information.
